# task-manager
This program is a task manager for a small business. Created as part of my training with Hyperion Dev.
It asks the user to login and checks their credentials. Then shows them a menu according to their permissions.
A regular user can add a new task, see all the tasks on the system and see their own tasks.
The admin user can also register new users and consult the total of tasks and users on the linked data files.
